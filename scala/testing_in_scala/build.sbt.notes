The "scalatest" %% is equivalent to "scalatest_2.11.1"... it looks for the
version of scalatest matching your scala version.

I'm not sure how you get the other part of the version right. The book used 1.8,
but that was out of date. I played with it and poked ineffectually around SO for
a while before I tried 2.2, which worked. Overall I'm not crazy about sbt so
far, although I haven't given it much time. I might prefer maven or gradle.

The book recommends running reload and update from inside sbt. You can instead
just do `sbt reload` and `sbt update`. I imagine working from the interactive
sbt console is likely faster, though. It seems to take a lot of time to load.

You can set up constant testing in sbt from the console by writing `~test`.
