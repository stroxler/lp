# Code to accompany "Testing in Scala" by Daniel Hinojosa

## Prerequisites

I will update install scripts as needed, for example if I run on Linux. On
mac as of me writing this, you will get Scala 2.11 and sbt if you run
`brew install scala`, which is sufficient to begin working on this code.
To actually get all of the dependencies, you want to also run `sbt`, which will
download a lot of stuff. Just hit Ctl-D when you get into the interactive shell.
