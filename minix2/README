I recently picked up the 2nd edition of the Minix
operating systems book. I'm actually kind of excited to read
it even thought it's out of date, because this was the last
"teaching" focused version of Minix - starting with Minix 3 it
tried to be a useful operating system, which on the one hand
makes it better to know in some sense, but on the other hand
expands the scope and code size tremendously.

This second-edition code has the benefit of ten years of
feedback (and the fact that between the late 80's and late 90's
there was just a lot of development - e.g. Linux came out),
but still has relatively small code, and the book even with
full code listing is under 900 pages, only about 500 of text.

The code is open-sourced and freely available at 
http://minix1.woodhull.com/teaching/teach_ver.html, but you
have to down load it as .TAZ[(!) apparently this is .tgz)
files, so I thought it would be good to make a repo entry.
In addition, I may wind up commenting the code a lot as I
read the book
