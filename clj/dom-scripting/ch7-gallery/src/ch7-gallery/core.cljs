; What does this demo show?
;
; I port the add-to-window.onload function that the author gives in Chapter 6
; to clojurescript (I didn't d it in Chapter 6). I also factored out the dev
; setup (enabling console printing and connecting the repl) into a function
; which can be added.
;
; I stopped returning false from the click handler. That's a bad way of
; preventing link following for a few reasons:
;   - first, it's possibly not part of the W3 standard (although I've never
;     actually seen a browser fail to support it
;   - second, it's confusing for non-front-end developers, whereas preventing
;     the default response to clicking a link is self-explanatory
;   - third - and maybe most important - you can do it up front, which prevents
;     the situation I keep encountering where there's a bug that throws an
;     error in the handler... and then the link is followed so you can't see
;     the error!
; Using preventDefault is way way better :)
;
; The html no longer has the #image and #caption elements, so we use adding
; them as a chance to show off the DOM api for adding elements.
;
; In the process, we define clojurescript-idiomatic wrappers around the DOM
; api functions
;   createElement, createTextNode, appendChild, and insertBefore
; and we also define our own
;   insert-after
; function, which the DOM api doesn't provide.
;
; The create-elt function also has some new clojure stuff (for me) in it:
;   how to make variadic functions
;   how to use a doseq over a map
;     answer: use the usual syntax plus vector destructuring
;   how to convert a string or keyword into a string (useful for host APIs!)
;     answer: use the name function
