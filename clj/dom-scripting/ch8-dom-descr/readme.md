Chapter 8 from DOM Scripting

Chapter 8 is on adding content to a webpage, with
a particular eye toward adding new displayes at load time
based on existing content.

We go through two very similar examples here:
  - adding a definition list by finding all the <abbr>
    tags in the document
  - Appending a "source" superscript link to all the
    <blockquote> elements in the document.

The book has an additional example involving access keys,
but since I have not written the pages his access key
links point to, and at any rate it is more of the same, I
am skipping that last example.
