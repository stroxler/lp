Starting "Getting Started with D3" in clojurescript

This code is the first half of Chapter 2, which is a
status board to serve as a plain html introduction to d3.

What have I learned here?
  - I got practice in using the enter / exit / update
    methods properly (the book author does not, nore does
    he explain what is going on, but it makes sense after
    watching some intro videos)
  - I got to use d3 to handle plain html manipulations
  - I practiced *not* using the d3 method to fetch data,
    but rather using plain ajax.
