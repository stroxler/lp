Chapter 5 of the book covers d3 layouts, which are
transformations of data. For example, the histogram
layout will convert data into binned data.

There's also a neat little trick in the stacked
histogram example where there are two calls to data
in a chain, with the second one as the identity function.
This is a d3 way of recursing down into the top-level
data structure.

That said, I'm going to skip Chapter 5, because it's
using non-generic D3 tools that need explanation, and
I find the author's explanations of what's going on
insufficient to really follow along.
