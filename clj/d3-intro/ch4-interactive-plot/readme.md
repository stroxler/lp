An adaptation of the Chapter 4 example.

I made a couple relevant changes:
 - I handle the labels differently, I think in a
   much cleaner way than the author although the
   end result is very similar.
 - I skipped the animation that zooms left to right,
   which I decided is not worth the effort (I find it
   slightly silly). But I did leave the tooltip
   animation.

What is shown here?
 - how to use `this` in clojurescript
 - how to use `this` in d3 event handlers
 - how to use transition to change attributes of
   existing elements
 - how to use delay to get animations
 - how to do tooltips
 - I personally think the axis handling code
   is cleaner than previous chapters

I still doubt that this is a good example of
idiomatic d3 code, but there is a lot of functionality
in this example that you can refer to.
