# An Introduction to Statistical Learning in R

These are my `.Rmd` files to accompany the book *An Introduction to Statistical
Learning in R*, by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert
Tibshirani.

I don't anticipate creating a proper package for this because I expect
almost all their example to use off-the-shelf software. That could
change, in which case I will reorganize and move my `.Rmd` files to
`vignettes`.
