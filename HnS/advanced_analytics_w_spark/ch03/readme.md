Chapter 3: Recommender systems

Unfortunately, the computer I was running on did not have enough ram to really
handle this data. I was able to finish the data extraction pipeline, as you
can see in the code, but I was unable to fully cache the dataset - which should
have been around 1 Gb - and I was completely unable to run ALS due to heap
errors.

For now at least, I am moving on; I skimmed the rest of the chapter and will
review the code in the `aas` github repo carefully at some point in the future.
