# Learn Programming

Up until now I have been making many different repositories for my personal
programming studies. I have decided that for small self-study projects I would
rather start gathering them up in a single repository.

The main reason to consolidate is organization: I currently hop computers
pretty often due to working at Terminal.com, and with a single repo for my
self-study I will no longer need to remember which projects are on which
machines, or think about the different directory structures I happened to use
in different places.
